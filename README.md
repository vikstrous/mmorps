A random project for #sehackday

This is a web app in node.js where users are given a choice of two images every round. If they choose the same image as the majority of people, they earn 1 point.


TODO:

- load images from reddit dynamically instead of a list of local images
- leaderboards
- give less points based on the ratio between the two choices
- indicate to everyone who has already played
- display a 15 second count down
- allow the user to participate in the first round when they join instead of waiting for the next one
- better UI
- change the name to something that makes sense
